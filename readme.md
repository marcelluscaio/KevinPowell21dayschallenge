Use of % for width
Use of max-width
Use of em and rem
Not use height. If necessary, use min-height or padding
Flexbox: parent is flex, children are going to take minimum space as possible.
Flexbox row stretches the height of all item to be the sema height. You can control that with "align items flex-start". Or you can wrap the item you don t want to stretch in a div. Or you can use align-self "flex-start"
